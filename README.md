Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software. It is important as it ensures that software solutions are built efficiently, securely and maintainable ensuring inovation and economic growth.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- The birth of the first programming language in 1947
- The rise of object oriented proramming in the 1980s
- The emergence of agile and DevOps (2001)


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Design - Creating a blueprint of how the software will look like.
- Development - Writing the code for the software solution.
- Testing - Identifying and fixing bug to ensure the software runs smoothly.
- Deployment - Releasing the software for use.
- Support - Fixing bugs and improving the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall development methodology is a sequential development method where one phase has to be completed before moving to the next, for example the whole design has to be completed before development begins, while agile development methodology is a flexible, iterative and collaborative approach where development happens in smaii, inscremental cycles. It allows for changes to be done while the software is still in development


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- A sofware engineer is responsible for writing the quality code for the software while a quality assurance engineer is responsible for making sure that the developed software by the software engineer is of high quality. A project manager on the other hand ensures that the whole software development process happens smoothly and is completed in time.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs provide an interface where an engineer write and edits instructions(code) that guides a machine while VCS help back up and track the changes made to the code.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Sometimes the user doesn't always know what they want. A software engineer is responsible for taking the requirements carefully from the user.
- Bugs can sometimes be hard to fix. Use debugging tools and ask a tech community for ideas or solutions.
- Tight deadlines. Use project management tools and break tasks into smaller achievable tasks.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing is the individual testing of modules to ensure they work well independently.
- Integration testing is the testing to ensure that different modules work together seamlessly.
- System testing is the testing of the whole system to ensure it works well as a whole to ensure it meets requirements.
- Acceptance is conducted by the users of the system to ensure it fits the business needs and requirements before deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the practice of creating clear and effective instructions (prompts) to an AI language model to get the best response from the model


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Write code for user authentication
- Write a Java Spring boot user authentication system using JWT, include login, registration and token validation using a MySQL database.
-The prompt is effective as it gives clear instuctions and is more specific on the technologies to be used.
